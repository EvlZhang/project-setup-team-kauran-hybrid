# Guide to Contributing

## Project's Values and Team Norms
- Communicate
- Meet at least 2x a week
- "Done" means that the function is working properly and integrated with everyone else's code

## Git workflow rules
- Every team member should have a working branch for each feature they are developing
- Make changes locally and save
- Pull everyone else's changes
- Stage and commit to your own working branch
- Handle any merge conflicts that arise during push

## Rules of contributing
- Pull before you push
- If there are merge conflicts, use a mergetool to merge the version from the remote repository with their local repository version

## How disagreements and conflicts will be solved
- Handle these at Daily Scrum
- If issues continue to persist after 2 Daily Scrum meetings, bring the issue up with Jaya or Prof

## Instructions for setting up the local development environment
- TBD

## Instructions for building and testing the project (update with that information once the project reaches that stage)
- TBD
