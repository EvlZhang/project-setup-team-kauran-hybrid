# Guide to Contributing

## Project's Values and Team Norms
- Communicate
- Meet at least 2x a week
- "Done" means that the function is working properly and integrated with everyone else's code

## Git workflow rules
- Every team member should have a working branch for each feature they are developing
- Make changes locally and save
- Pull everyone else's changes before you push
- Handle any merge conflicts that arise before push, never override other people's code without permission

## Rules of contributing
- Everybody should contribute equally
- update each other at daily scrum
- communicate frequently and effectively before the daily scrum meetings 

## How disagreements and conflicts will be solved
- Handle these at Daily Scrum
- If issues continue to persist after 2 Daily Scrum meetings, bring the issue up with Jaya or Prof

## Instructions for setting up the local development environment
- Clone the repository
- will be updated later when we have a database setup

## Instructions for building and testing the project (update with that information once the project reaches that stage)
- TBD
