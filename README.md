# Project: Waitlisted?

## Project Vision Statement

### Minimum Viable Product
We want our users (NYU students) to be able to enter their course number and waitlist position in order to get a reasonable estimate of the probability that they will make it off the waitlist into the course.

On the same page as the probability results, we would like to offer students a list of (open) alternative elective courses that they could choose to take instead, with optionality to filter by similar department as the original course searched, same or similar time as the original course searched, or other courses that happen to be open but are (mostly) unrelated to the original course searched.

From this list of classes we display, the student can choose to view more information about the open elective, including the time & place, brief introduction, prerequisites, and professor information - which can lead to a more detailed review of the professor and other classes they may teach.

Students also have the optionality to choose to have their searches retained and tracked via an account linked to their NYU email, or to use the service as a one-off program.

### Themes  (not sure if this is how it should be done tbh)
- algorithm prediction functionality
- open elective offerings
- account and historical search tracking

## History of the Project and How to Contribute
The project idea was inspired by NYU and Albert's lack of transparency regarding class sizes and waitlists and overall poor registration system.  As a student, it is difficult to gauge whether you should stay on a waitlist or choose to find another elective earlier on given these issues.  We aim to fix this.  You can find the original project proposal here: https://github.com/agile-dev-assignments/project-proposal-evlz/blob/main/README.md

## Instructions for building and testing
(update with that information once the project reaches that stage)

## Instructions for the README.md below (delete this section later)

Every project must have a README.md that automatically renders on the project's main repository page with basic details of the project, including:

a description of project, including the Product Vision Statement
the core team members, including links to their GitHub accounts and any other web presence they have
a short history of how the project came to be and information about how to contribute to the project (i.e. a link to the CONTRIBUTING.md document)
instructions for building and testing the project (update with that information once the project reaches that stage)
links to any additional Markdown documents or web pages that may be relevant reading about the project
anything else you think is important to communicate to people viewing the project
